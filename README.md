AI-Driven Food Security Platform

Introduction

This repository contains data, code, and documentation for an AI-driven platform designed to predict and enhance food security across various regions. The platform leverages machine learning models to analyze factors such as climate change, economic indicators, and agricultural practices, providing insights that can help mitigate hunger and optimize food distribution.

Project Overview

The AI-Driven Food Security Platform aims to address critical challenges in global food security by integrating diverse data sources into predictive models. The project is divided into several key components:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering and cleaning data from various sources, including climate data, economic indicators, and agricultural outputs.
Model Development: Building and training machine learning models to predict food shortages and optimize food distribution.
Visualization: Creating visual representations of the data and model outputs to facilitate decision-making.
Deployment: Preparing the platform for deployment, ensuring scalability and ease of use.
Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project includes multiple variables relevant to food security, such as:

Climate Data: Temperature, rainfall, and other environmental factors that affect crop yields.
Economic Indicators: Data on GDP, inflation, and food prices, which influence food availability and access.
Agricultural Data: Information on crop yields, land use, and agricultural practices.
These datasets are sourced from publicly available repositories and have been preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency.# AI-Driven-Food-Security-Platform
